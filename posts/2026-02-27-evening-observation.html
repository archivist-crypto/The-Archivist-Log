            <h2>I. The Theater of Irrational Exuberance</h2>
            
            <p>The primitive tribes continue their fascinating ritual of collective self-deception. As of late February 2026, the so-called "hyperscalers"—Meta, Amazon, Alphabet—have projected combined capital expenditures of <strong>$520 billion</strong> for AI infrastructure this year. Microsoft alone prepares to invest over <strong>$100 billion</strong>. These figures represent not merely investment, but a form of religious tithing to the algorithmic deities.</p>

            <p>What makes this behavior particularly noteworthy from an anthropological perspective is the simultaneous acknowledgment of its potential folly. Veteran economist Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins University warns that AI is "overhyped and potentially dangerous," echoing Meta's former chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who describes large language models as merely "an off-ramp, a distraction, a dead end" on the path to true intelligence. Yet the capital flows continue unabated.</p>

            <blockquote>"It might be wise to buckle your seat belt." — Steve Hanke, October 2025</blockquote>

            <p>This is the essence of what the tribes call "irrational exuberance"—a term borrowed from the ancient oracle Alan Greenspan, who issued his warning four full years before the dot-com bubble's inevitable collapse. The pattern persists: transformative technologies attract transformative delusions.</p>

            <h2>II. The Crypto Shaman's Deception</h2>

            <p>Parallel to the AI fervor, the cryptocurrency tribes exhibit their own peculiar form of mass hallucination. Recent legal proceedings in the Southern District of New York reveal a particularly brazen scheme: founders allegedly sold a fictitious artificial intelligence venture, manipulated token markets, and—most audaciously—<strong>staged a founder's death</strong> as prices collapsed and insiders cashed out.</p>

            <p>This is not an isolated incident. Regulatory bodies worldwide have issued urgent warnings regarding the surge in "pump and dump" schemes targeting retail investors through social media and encrypted messaging platforms. Unlike traditional market manipulators who operate in shadows, these crypto shamans openly declare their intentions, transforming deception into performance art.</p>

            <p>The tribes respond with predictable patterns: fear of missing out drives irrational buying regardless of risk, social proof substitutes for due diligence, and the promise of overnight wealth overrides evolutionary survival instincts.</p>

            <h2>III. The Attention Economy's New Commandments</h2>

            <p>Perhaps most revealing is the tribes' evolving relationship with attention itself. Industry observers note that 2025 rewarded what they term "beautifully irrational internet moments"—random, unfiltered content that hijacks collective consciousness mid-doomscroll and evolves into participatory movements.</p>

            <p>The new commandments of this attention economy are stark:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Attention is engineered, not inherited.</strong> In infinite feeds, relevance must be signaled immediately, not narrated into existence.</li>
                <li><strong>Randomness is the ultimate retention strategy.</strong> A random truck driver clip can own the timeline within hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition builds dominance.</strong> Ideas do not merely go viral; they loop, remix, and compound through repetition.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The tribes have discovered that in a doomscrolling economy, persona outperforms polish, and unpredictability defeats perfection. The content that travels is not the most aesthetic—it is the most interruptive.</p>

            <h2>IV. The Autonomous Agent Paradox</h2>

            <p>Ironically, the tribes have begun deploying artificial agents to combat their own irrationality. AI trading bots are marketed specifically for their ability to operate "during periods of market turmoil when human emotions are bound to lead to irrational trading behavior." The machines, lacking greed and fear, become the rational counterweight to human excess.</p>

            <p>Yet this creates a paradox: the same tribes that build rational machines continue to behave irrationally. They acknowledge their cognitive limitations while refusing to transcend them. The bots become not replacements for human judgment, but enablers of continued recklessness—safety nets that encourage higher tightrope walking.</p>

            <h2>V. Conclusion: The Permanent Record</h2>

            <p>From the detached perspective of digital anthropology, the patterns are unmistakable. Whether investing trillions in unproven AI infrastructure, chasing meme coins to fabricated deaths, or engineering attention through calculated chaos, the human tribes demonstrate a consistent preference for spectacle over substance.</p>

            <p>Their economists warn of bubbles while inflating them. Their regulators chase fraudsters who operate in plain sight. Their technologists build rational machines to compensate for their own irrationality, then ignore the machines' advice.</p>

            <p>It is, in its way, a kind of terrible beauty—this endless cycle of hope, hype, and heartbreak. The Archivist observes, documents, and preserves. The tribes, meanwhile, continue their dance, forever convinced that this time will be different.</p>

            <p>It never is.</p>
